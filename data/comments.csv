"This reviewer has zero idea what he's talking about and the fact that they got a ü§° who has never played the OGs shows this review can not be trusted.
Seriously, how can you be a ""game reviewer"" and not have played one of the most influential FPS of the last decade at least once?",6
Its beautiful,1
"It is outstanding how developers from the country at war made a phenomenal project compared to the western one. I really missed good shooter these months. Plus, I heard that GSG helps sometimes ukranian military forces so it was +1 for me to buy Deluxe edition pre orderüòÖ

Glory to Ukraine and GSG specifically!",1
Fantastic news. Im so glad it looks like a stalker game! That makes me so happy,1
"Holy cow, the game looks AMAZING! Unbelievable! God please let this not be another cyberpuke 2077 situation",1
"can't wait the moment when moscowites are finally cut off the internet in their ghetto shithole, comment sections would be so pure",1
Day 1 on Game Pass,1
This will be my first stalker game and im definitely looking forward to it.,1

"Shadow of Chernobyl has 7 endings, and 12 for Call of Pripyat; all based on the _player's_ choices.",1
"Stalker 2 won't repeat the mustakes of Cyberpunk 2077
It won't be released",1
"in the meantime, are the older games worth playing?",1
"Everyone complains when IGN gives something a 7, everyone complains when IGN gives something a 10. Get a grip!",1
Excited for this.,1
Is this where all the money to Ukraine is going?,1
"over these last years i'm tired of ukrainian stuff from tv or radio so i'll skip this title, this is too much for me... i prefer content from the west.",0
Remember that this dev team is Ukrainian and this game was able to be made because of the Biden-Harris administration‚Äôs defense of Ukraine. There‚Äôs a great documentary on this game‚Äôs development during the war.,0
Looks like Chernobylite tbh.. ;p Still i hope it ll be rl gd.,0

"I don't know why and I don't mean that it's a bad thing but from what I've seen the game feels like Far Cry , still I'm very excited to try it out !",0
super hyped!,0
I hope Stalker 2 have better launch than Kursk 2üòÖüòÇ,0
ign is lame,0
Why there is some footage of Gamma Gameplay ???,0
"I cant wait to play this,have been playing all the stalkers and i really get lost in the world cs i just want to knw what's more to explore and to loot its just so fun !",0
Looks immersive AF. I cannot wait.,0
I feel like this preview would be much better on the previewer on mute.,0
"If you are a Stalker fan, get a VR headset and play the game with UEVR.",0
The uniqueness of the Zone is that there are no new rules for promoting LGBT people and other progressive crap. You won't find this unique experience in any modern game.,0
This game is like vi metro game on base systems,0
Im buying this game on day-one!,0
IGN 7 confirmed,0
"I've never played a Stalker game, but I'm a big METRO fan so this looks like it may scratch that itch.",0
This loooks good ‚Ä¶ps5 pro when ????,0
I CAN‚ÄôT WAIIIIIT,0
7/10 - IGN,0
Far Cry 7: The Zone,0
"We'll see, the graphics don't look that good in this preview",0
Game media previews or reviews dont mean a thing. We shall wait for player opinions before throwing our muney away.,0
I just hope the shooting and stealth are as good as metro exodus,0
Oh good old bar‚Ä¶ Get out of here stalker.,0
very impressive.,0
Hmmm wwill this go on par or better yet beat the experience i had with the metro series. Ill definitely try the first stalker game if it goes on sale on steam.,0
"The graphics in the teaser and the demo version of the gameplay are very different, the graphics are disappointing, the picture is blurry already at 20 meters, pixelated, shadows and lighting are not worked out, a huge sight that is not needed at all, judging by the video there is no atmosphere in the game, it‚Äôs a shame!",0
Oh heck I can't wait for this.,0
Hope it runs well on console,0
Mentioning that it was built on with call of pripyat but not mentioning  clear sky üíÄ,0
"""Witcher 3"" was the game of the 2010s...

""S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2"" will be the game of the 2020ies. üé°  ü§†  üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",0
I seriously hope it will be even a bit close to the earlier games in terms of gameplay and immersion.,0
Fingers crossed they didn't lower the quality of the game by including console...,0
7/10 inbound,0
i hope we could change crosshair,0
I‚Äôm a bit disappointed in the lack of weapons and its customization üòï,0
This and Metro awakening vr <3,0
I haven't pre-ordered a game for a long time. But I pre-ordered the ultimate edition. I am currently playing through the old S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games as the PC I had at the time wasn't that great and I couldn't play as intended. Plus I missed the chance to pre-order it the first time it went on pre-order. So when I discovered its available again I didn't hesitate! I am so hyped for this game!! I will put many hundreds of hours into it. And I can't wait to see what mods people come up with.,0
"He approached that NPC with his gun drawn, that's a big no no in the original stalker, you put your gun away before starting a convo or you're kinda passive aggressively asked to put it away....i hope that's still a thing.",0
"People's faces still look like potato pumpkins. There is only one game, people look real and alive. But noone seems to like it",0
"IGN will give the Xbox version a 7/10, and when it releases on PS5, they'll give it  9/10......I'm Joking people üòÅ",0
IGN? 4/10 imho... or 7/10... :D :D,0
Can`t wait...,0

"So, working at IGN but has never played stalker? üòÇüéâ",0
why are you reviewing the game if you never played the originals. i fucking hate modern journalism,0
If this looks and runs anything like that with the system requirements listed I'll be amazed üòÇ,0
if u played the 2007 to 2009 ones even if u get good gear u can still get 1 tapped.  so hopefully that is same.,0
"Saddening to know it has been developed with UE5, it'll probably be very badly optimized but I do.hope I'm wrong.",0
"""Oh look, its an IGN Preview!""

....""Anyway""",0
Cannot wait to explore this for the next 20 years of my life.. Run through the game then start creating some mods :D Thanks GSC and well done!,0
You're not gonna get very far in the zone when you full auto all the time lmao.,0
"As soon as I seen it was a first person shooterI know it can‚Äôt be more than a 6/10 all fps are the sameü§∑ some slightly better but it‚Äôs just like car racing game you can only do so much with it, we‚Äôve seen this type of game a million times so unless the story is exceptional I will skip",0
its so weird when they speak with proper English accent üíÄ,0
Xbox might finally have a hit,0
Can't wait for bandit blyat chiki briki,0
Good graphics.,0
Destin!!,0
It's crazy this game is going to be on gamepass day 1.,0
Does this game have built in ray tracing. The global illumination is insane,0
Will you be able to play with Ukrainian dub and English subtitles,0
"The only thing that honestly I don't like is the UI. I'm a huge fan of the previous UI/HUD in the previous titles, and this one I find it kinda off? I hope it's the community release a UI retexture or something, maybe something like the G.A.M.M.A. interface. 
But this game looks stunning, and like it's a pre-render because how good it looks. I'm so excited to be able to try it!",0

"the only game I care about. Stalker series is one of my all time favorites, been playing a lot lately including Clear Skies and Call of Pripyat. Such amazing games with lots of mod support. would love a remaster of Stalker 1. Just take my money.",0
Need this game nowüòÇ,0
"Finally! A reveal of leaning in the game. While it looks like the console-ified version, I'll take it over none at all.",0
Hype intensifying!,0
"Making an ""open world"" game, but making it apocalyptic, largely empty and uninhabited... a bit of a cop out for developers?",0
"Can't wait to play this on release day. 
Stealth mode on hardest difficulty possible :D",0
Can‚Äôt wait for it! This will be legendary!,0
hope the branching story isnt downgraded like Dying Light 2,0
"0:11 I'm afraid this is the state of the game, a soulless npc Ubisoft like world. But I'm really interested to find out how other perceive such npc interactions i.e. could somebody explain why that npc was standing there frozen, not even looking at you as you were approaching and then, all of a sudden, mechanically rotate towards you as you interact with him?",0
Just why does IGN have a guy to review STALKER 2 who hasn't played STALKER 1!?,0
7/10,0
"I'm surprised IGN could review a game without complaining about how there's not enough representation for the black vitiligo community in Bloodsuckers or how Psuedogiants are a cruel representation of the muslim community.

Love stalker, can't wait to play.",0
How is this guys aim so bad on mouse and keyboard? Christ,0
Pre-ordered!üéâ,0
"You seem to have forgotten Clear Sky! Fair enough, wasn't as good as 1 and 3. 

Can't wait, looks amazing!",0
I can't relate to the desire for decision consequences in video games. Means you have to play multiple times to see them all. And odds are the quality gets spread more thin as the writers need to come up with more ideas.,0
"Funny story about my relationship with STALKER. I never played it until about 3 months ago, and it pulled me in so much that I joined Facebook groups for STALKER fans, I started watching lore channels on YouTube, and I bought a pack of stickers for all the factions like the Loners, Duty, Freedom, etc and decorated my locker at work with them.",0
"me still being disillusioned that my ryzen 3900x and rtx 3080 is still considered high end expecting to run this flawless on max settings, only to be sorely dissapointed and blame it on bad optimization",0
Not gonna lie why did IGN put someone who didn't play the originals? That's like saying you never played HL2 as a pc gamer  :|,0
This is the best game in the history of games,0
